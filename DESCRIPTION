Description: Package to predict protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks in 
    target organisms for which only a view information about 
    PPIs is available. Path2PPI predicts PPI networks based on sets of 
    proteins which can belong to a certain pathway from well-established model 
    organisms. It helps to combine and transfer information of a certain 
    pathway or biological process from several reference organisms to one 
    target organism. Path2PPI only depends on the sequence similarity of the 
    involved proteins.
