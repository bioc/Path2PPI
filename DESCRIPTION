Description: Package to predict pathway specific protein-protein interaction 
    (PPI) networks in target organisms for which only a view information about 
    PPIs is available. Path2PPI uses PPIs of the pathway of interest from other 
    well established model organisms to predict a certain pathway in the target 
    organism. Path2PPI only depends on the sequence similarity of the involved 
    proteins.
